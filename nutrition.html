          <h2>Main focus: caloric intake</h2>
          <p class="article-text">
            Powerlifters are among the athletes with the highest required
            caloric intake, due to the high training intensity and to recover
            fast enough for the next training session or competition. Even in
            the off-season you are advised to stay in a caloric surplus. The
            International Society of Sports Nutrition suggests 40-70
            kcals/kg/day for strength athletes training 2-3 hours daily,
            compared to 25-35 kcals/kg/day for the average fitness enthusiast.

          <h2>Macronutrient balance</h2>
          <p class="article-text">
            Which nutrients do we need to focus on? Aside from a healthy balance
            in vitamins and minerals, which everyone needs, proteins are the top
            priority, as they are the primary building blocks for your muscles.
            The suggestion here is 1.6-1.7g protein/kg/day in 20g servings, 5-6
            times daily. Carbohydrates provide energy and refill glycogen
            storages. This is particularly helpful before (and after) training
            sessions. The suggested intake is 4-7g/kg/day.

          <h2>Supplements</h2>
          <p class="article-text">
            There is an astronomic amount of supplements available on the
            market. However, 95% of these have been unsufficiently tested to
            prove their alledged effects. At this moment these are the most
            researched and scientifically backed supplements:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Whey protein</dt>
            <dd>
              Whey is a concentrated protein supplement in powder form. During
              the production of cheese, whey is produced as a byproduct. You can
              mix this powder with water, milk, yoghurt etc, to make your
              protein intake cheaper and less time-consuming.
            </dd>
            <dt>Caffein</dt>
            <dd>
              Just like jumpstarting your day with a morning coffee, caffein can
              be consumed in other forms, in powder or as a pill, to enhance
              your energy production during training.
            </dd>
            <dt>Creatine</dt>
            <dd>
              Last but definitely not least. Creatine is a powerfull tool in
              your arsenal if you want to take your training to the next level.
              This supplement improves hydration and stored energy levels in
              muscle cells. If you want to know more, check out this article on
