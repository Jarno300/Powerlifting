          <p class="article-text">
            Training is, next to nutrition, the most important part of your
            journey. Like nutrition there is a lot of misinformation out there.
            Mainly content creators will claim certain exercises or training
            plans are revolutionary, just to keep the content going. This way
            the pool of information around this subject becomes heavily
            dilluted. On this page we summarize the most researched and most
            commonly recommended training programs available.

            Never held a barbell in your life? Start here. This program is
            designed to get used to the main movements. Once you feel
            comfortable and your technique is solid, move on to one of the more
            refined routines.

          <p class="article-text">
            GZCLP is a beginner to intermediate level linear progression
            program, consisting of three lifts each workout day. It offers a
            significantly more balanced exercise selection and effective
            progression than most other linear progression programs, especially
            with regards to squat vs deadlift balance.

            Consistancy is key, no matter what program you decide to follow. On
            the other hand it's not a bad idea to change things up every now an
            then. You can find an extended archive of routines at
